Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products. It was developed by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. Its development started in 1993 and was worked until 1995, when they co-presented a paper describing the Scrum at the [Business Object Design and Implementation](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540760962) as part of [OOPSLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA) Conference in 1995. It was the first public appearance of the framework. 

It appears that the term "Scrum" comes from [The New New Product Development Game](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game), an 1986 article that compares high-performing, cross-functional teams to the scrum formation used by rugby teams¹. Jeff is now the CEO of [Scrum Inc.](https://www.scruminc.com/). Ken founded the [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/), [Scrum Alliance](https://www.scrumalliance.org/) and recently after leaving the Scrum Alliance, founded [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/).
Both are signatories to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) in 2001. 

The whole methodology can be found at [Scrum Guides](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).
